# NCTU - Introduction to Network Programming

My solutions to the homework of Introduction to Network Programming, offered by Professor Chun-Ying Huang in NCTU, Autumn 2021.

## Specification

1. [Homework #1](https://hackmd.io/@Cw77l7QTQyuEGh-tVg3fjA/SyfBvXd4t)
2. [Homework #2](https://hackmd.io/@john6090212/H1c_lcr8t)
3. [Homework #3](https://hackmd.io/@artis24106/rkgQs3iuK)

Note that there are some points I didn't get
- Homework #1
  - Unknown 5%
- Homework #2
  - example/multiple 2%
  - update-post/mp 2%
- Homework #3
  - 9-advance2 10%
<!-- However, that's fine for me since I got 110% and 100% on midterm and final, respectively -->

## Code Structure

Since homework #2 is an extended version of homework #1, I decided to refactor the code into MVC pattern, making the writing process in the future more efficiently.
